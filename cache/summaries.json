Tokens are the fundamental units processed by the model, and efficient token usage can reduce costs and improve speed. Embeddings represent the meaning of text as numeric vectors, useful for various applications like semantic search and classification. Prompts should be structured clearly to guide the model's responses, with specific controls available to adjust creativity and output length. The processing of text involves tokenization, embedding, attention mechanisms, and decoding to generate coherent outputs.","tags":["LLM","tokens","embeddings","prompts","text processing"],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":410,"completion_tokens":138,"total_tokens":548,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}}}}
