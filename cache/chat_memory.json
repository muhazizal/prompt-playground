This includes:\n\n1. **Understanding Context**: Recognizing the situational factors that influence the interaction, such as the user's intent, previous interactions, and environmental variables.\n\n2. **Maintaining State**: Keeping track of the ongoing state of a conversation or task. This involves remembering what has been said or done previously, which helps in providing coherent and relevant responses.\n\n3. **Dynamic Updates**: Adapting to changes in context as new information becomes available or as the user’s needs evolve. This can involve updating the context when the user provides new input or when external conditions change.\n\n4. **Contextual Relevance**"
