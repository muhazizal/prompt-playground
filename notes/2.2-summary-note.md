The Notes Assistant is a feature that reads Markdown files from the `notes/` directory and provides AI-powered summaries and analysis.

**Features:**
- **List Notes:** `GET /notes/list` returns available note files.
- **Batch Processing:** `POST /notes/process` summarizes all notes, providing a summary, tags, usage stats, and a quality evaluation for each.
- **Streaming Summaries:** `GET /notes/summarize-stream?path=<file>` uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream the summary, tags, usage, and evaluation in real-time.
- **Tag Management:** `GET/POST /notes/tags` allows viewing and updating the list of possible tags, which are stored in `config/tags.json`.
- **Firebase Integration:** Summaries and results are saved to Firestore if configured.

**Architecture:**
- `api/notes.mjs`: Registers all `/notes/*` routes.
- `api/notes-core.mjs`: Contains all business logic (reading files, calling OpenAI, caching embeddings).
- `web/app/pages/notes.vue`: The frontend UI that interacts with the notes API endpoints.
